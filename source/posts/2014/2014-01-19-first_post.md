I've been saying it for years, "I should make a website!". However "Graphic Design" and "Presentation" aren't really things that excite me and so motivation was hard to come by. Sure there are CMS frameworks; but for a little website to display my random thoughts, the learning curve and time involved really meant that it never happened. Fortunately I follow an awesome dude named Paul Fenwick and he built [this site](http://pjf.id.au/) and encouraged others to fork the codebase. Of which I was more than happy to oblige. Thanks Paul!

Now to populate the site with content! :D
