Seven years ago, a younger me, a guy a year into his first software engineering role, ended this [post](../2017/2017-01-08-overhauling_techman83.me.md) with:

This was also probably a couple of months prior to my ADHD diagnosis, which I'm sure is completely unrelated! A lot has happened in that time, which mostly involved coming to peace with the reality that anything which introduces friction is a barrier to getting anything done. This is especially the case when it's something that I do in my spare time. Back then I naively figured moving to [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) would remove friction as it was Python based, but it wasn't long before all the things I'd tried to carry over from my previous site broke. Then life got busy, and the site became stale.

With the state of the internet suffering widespread [enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/04/teach-me-how-to-shruggie/#kagi), I figured it was time give my personal site a clean up! I'd been putting this off for a long time, even had a few goes at it before hitting that invisible wall of friction. Recently with one of my side projects '[Cally](https://cally.callyco.io/)', I had spent time with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). Now this might seem like an odd choice for a personal website, but my Day-to-Day as a Lead DevOps Engineer, generating documentation from our python based tooling is a common task. Choosing something I use frequetly, which will extend my knowledge of the tool, is far more important than for purpose tool that I'll use rarely. So after finding [Ablog](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) a few weeks ago, thus began what you read today.

Here's hoping that it's not another 7 years of no posts! :D
