About Techman83
===============

I am an outgoing DevOps/Programmer/Developer with over 20 years of experience. I have a passion for People, Technology, Open Source, Automation and Embedded Hardware. I’m involved with a number of Open Source projects and have attended, volunteered, and assisted with the organisation of `Linux Conf AU <https://linux.org.au/linux-conf-au>`_, along with attending the successor `Eveything Open <https://everythingopen.au/>`_.

Outside of my day to day, I’m the infrastructure/indexing development lead for `KSP-CKAN <https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki>`_, the go-to mod manager for Kerbal Space Program. This involves working with a small team of developers located around the globe and ensuring operations are smooth for the predominantly non-developer user base.
